Machine Learning and Deep Learning using Python applications and study

I am studying Machine Learning and Deep Learning, but with a greater focus on MLP.
I use the Python language with Jupyter Notebook (and in some cases in Machine Learning I also use the R language).
I will use some Kaggle challenges as a targeted learning tool in order to intensify my studies
